Having completed my degree and in dire need of work I got a job
working in a bar in SOHO for a while. Ricardo Reino arrived at UCL
around that time and I lived in his room since I had nowhere else
to go. Soon after I lost my job. I became thin, unable to maintain
intercourse and in pretty bad general physical shape.

**By February still without work, money or a place to stay
and whilst being forced to hear vocal payloads roaming the streets
I found myself without any other option but to return to
Portugal.**
