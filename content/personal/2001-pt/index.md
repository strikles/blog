I returned to Portugal and complained to my mother I was being
forced to hear vocal payloads. She insisted I go see a psychiatrist
after which we visited a long string of psychiatrists all with
different outcomes.

My mother suggested I find a job so I tried working at [Lux]("https://www.luxfragil.com/") same place where Rui Reino worked before leaving to study at UCL. After 3 days I was fired for being "too blasé".

**My mother was forcefully committed to a psychiatric institution for attempting to file a complaint with the police due to alleged [delusions]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusion"), with Ricardo Reino communicating with me via vocal payloads after that.**

Whilst living in Calçada do Combro some of these people would entertain themselves by getting me to perform tasks. In order to get rid of the vocal payloads issued via forceful synthetic telepathy, I initially complied. One of the tasks was going to the GNR command and asking for a rolling paper.

**At a later time my father also complained crying of pain
in his anus and stating he had mental problems and should see a
psychiatrist whilst Ricardo Reino was forcefully communicating with
me via synthetic telepathy.**

Whilst under no-touch sensory overload at the house of
my gf at the time I lost my temper and broke a window in her house.
We split up, she left my things at my door. Soon after my father
suggested I see a psychiatrist and I was coerced/intimidated via
synthetic telepathy on what to report ("tell your doctor what
happened and that you are hearing voices"), forensic psychiatrist

<a href=
"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ant%C3%B3nio-gamito-67015584/">Antonio
Gamito</a> leading to a synthetic psychiatric profile.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A few years later my father ended up handicapped with a
prosthesis in his shoulder after falling down some stairs due to
insistence on taking me to the infamous psychiatric institution
<a href=
"https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_J%C3%BAlio_de_Matos">Hospital
Julio De Matos</a> to see a different psychiatrist (Luis
Gamito).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Some time elapsed with no torture occurrences until Luis
Figueira communicated with me via forced synthetic telepathy around
the 10th of January 2011 asking "what do you want?". Feeling
threatened and disrespected for the intermission I replied by
telling him to "fuck off" and a few seconds later I ended up
breaking everything around me and spitting all over the place
(including on my mothers face) as a consequence of being forced to
feel my skull and ear ducts "reverberating"b with an enraging sonic
payload consisting of amplified noise. Since then all my projects
regarding learning experiences have been sabotaged (coursera,
udacity and several personal projects) in order to try to force me
to work menial jobs and never get anywhere in life so that "I learn
my place in society".**

Around that same period I was remotely sodomized by
Portuguese individuals who stated that I was either going to cry or
jump out of a window. This occurred around the same period when I
asked Kasper Meilgaard if he was a homosexual over Google chat (I'm
not sure if those two events were related or if there was any
causation). Either. way this led to multiple altercations
including: 1 year waiting for trial to be forcefully committed;
stopping all my [PGM]("https://www.coursera.org/") online learning (including my beloved [PGM]("https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models") course) and destroying my family environment.\*\*

**Eventually the trial date arrived. I went by train. My
lawyer didn't say a single word the whole session despite my
indications. My father said the trial went great. I was furious. On
my way back Pedro Grilo stated via forced synthetic telepathy
"Estás arrumado" meaning "You are finished!"**

Ultimately I left Portugal looking for a brighter future in the Netherlands.
