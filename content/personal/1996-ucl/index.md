I joined [UCL]("https://www.ucl.ac.uk/") doing a
Physics and Space Science Degree in 08/1996. On my 1st days whilst
being guided through University I was taken to see the auto-icon of
[Jeremy Bentham]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham") the spiritual founder of UCL. I remember being told the
head was locked in a vault and then I wondered off as the topic
started diving into topics unrelated to my interests then. Strange
how with time those same topics have become so relevant to my
life...

"He advocated individual and economic freedoms, the separation of church and state, freedom of expression, equal rights for women, the right to divorce, and (in an unpublished essay) the decriminalizing of homosexual acts. He called for the abolition of slavery, capital punishment and physical punishment, including that of children. He has also become known as an early advocate of animal rights."

I was very motivated at the start, made a few friends and lived
in a UCL accommodation hall by Bloomsbury square. Soon after that I
became more interested in going out meeting new people, parties,
girls and all the excesses associated. At some point one of my
friends stopped going to lectures and started acting erratic,
ranting about the movie Dune and the main character Paul, asking
weird questions regarding killing with the power of your
voice. Me not being the most assiduous student and having
missed a few lab sessions, borrowed his lab book. Upon returning
it, I left it in a shop along the way. We shouted at each other and
I remember telling him "Never to talk to me again". I left. Next
day I was told he killed himself by jumping out of the window
whilst the R. Kelly song [I believe I can fly]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIQn8pab8Vc")
was playing on my radio, it felt so inappropriate. I was
later questioned by the police. They promptly stated they knew I
had nothing to do with it. I was surprised and asked "How ?". The
answer was evasive. The police officer also stated the father was a
candidate for prime-minister along with something regarding
directed energy weapons and his campaign. According to the police
officer the father accused me of being some Portuguese big drug
dealer yet he had a bank check for 50 pounds in my name in his
jacket pocket which didn't add up. The police officer also stated
he was suffering from **cannabis induced psychosis**
at the time of his death. I was perplexed. 3 or 4 people I knew
attended the funeral. It was a closed casket service. To this day I
wonder if he was also being tortured and if that is the reason why
he killed himself, or if it was the argument or both...

Rarely did I ever go to class. I noticed something was wrong
when intercourse with my gf was sabotaged (I guess what I felt was
a [ASMR]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_sensory_meridian_response"))
running down my spine generated by external stimuli and
leading to a premature orgasm).

In 1997 I was drafted into the army to fulfill my obligatory
service. I was studying at University at the time and had a
girlfriend so I saw a psychiatrist to come up with an excuse so I
could continue studying and move on with my life.

**In the summer of 1997 I returned to Portugal for summer
holiday and went to the 1st [Boom Festival]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbE0LuKhtxA")
with Hugo Pereira, a former student of Col√©gio Militar. We thought
about doing LSD. We found some guy took it and shortly after I
ended up stuck in Hugo's car for several hours filled with
synthetic migraines and hearing vocal payloads stating "Frita,
Frita, Frita" (fry in Portuguese). I nearly threw myself off a
ravine.**

**In my second year I still had a gf, my life was simple,
happy and uneventful and and my grades satisfactory. Eventually I
broke up and went back to partying and my grades declined. Whilst
with another girl intercourse was sabotaged again via the exact
same method.**

**By the 4th year I was poorly motivated. On the night
before my final exam of atomic and molecular physics (a subject for
which I attended 2 lectures at most) I lit a cannabis joint and I
immediately started hearing vocal payloads in Portuguese (a
language I wasn't even using or thinking in anymore) and my
studying session was sabotaged. I probably wouldn't do that well on
that exam anyway but at least I would have had a higher success
chance of passing if I managed to do some studying. In the end I
discarded that subject.**

My final project was under the same professor [Jonathan Tennyson](<"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Tennyson_(physicist)">)
on **"ab-initio calculation of ro-vibrational spectra of triterated triatomic molecules"**.
I handed in what I had at the moment which was a folder with some unfinished work.
As if by miracle I somehow managed to graduate with a 2:2 in the year 2000, but I let my final project partner [Dave Hodder]("https://github.com/dvhdr")
down and failed to attend the ceremony out of shame.

**In need of a job I went to an interview. whilst on the
way I started feeling a second heartbeat and my hands started to
sweat in an unnatural way (with the palms of my hands feeling like
they were vibrating via some external stimuli). It was a complete
nightmare, I was sweating all over my body and the interview was
sabotaged. It seemed evident someone wanted to kick me back to
Portugal.**
