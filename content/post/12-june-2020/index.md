09:30am - Again I'm forced to wake up by people connected to Tito Eurico Miranda Fernandes, Pedro Grilo, Luis Nazareth Carvalho Figueira, Amancio Santos, Alexandre Reis, Paulo Varanda, Ivo Costa (and several other former students from Colégio Militar, PSP officers and others recruited for this purpose) with my inner ear drum membrane being used to force the feeling someone is masturbating my right ear along with high amplitude and high frequency stimuli inducing hypersensibility and hyperhidrosis in less than 10 seconds.

09:39am - Forced to hear the vocal payload "Vou-me foder por esta merda" in a synthetic female tone of voice.

10:00am - Whilst I went outside to get a coffee the individuals torturing me decided to try to force a synthetic psychotic episode on the middle of the street by inducing involuntary tongue movements in order to force me to talk to myself in public resulting in me returning home immediately. As soon as I got home was forced to feel oscillatory noise payloads focused on my ears at a rhythm simulating masturbation.

10:40am - I'm being forced to talk to myself via being forced to hear synthesized vocal payloads alternating between English and Portuguese, being forced to provide an answer to the endless stream of meaningless questions and complete the many repeated partial payloads (via echolalia and nfcc) in front of a large number of people as a form of humiliation, never allowing me continuity of thought, forcing me into poor choices and restricting (and dramatically changing) my options and consequently my free will (forcing me to isolate myself at home) in order to force a synthetic psychotic episode that might culminate in suicide. This form of <strong>illegal sentence</strong> is so noxious I can't even maintain a regular breathing pattern living in a constant state of thoracic depression. It was issued when I was 18 years old by sabotaging intercourse multiple times, and transformed into 24 hours torture spectacle upon my return from holliday on Greece in 2015 whilst working at Eenvoudmedia. It consists of shows glorifying human degradation and is absolutely repulsive, permeating deeply, even in the workplace where people like <strong>Jasper Kums from Eenvoudmedia and Jorrit van der Laan from Quby</strong> got involved in my torture process, participating as executioner and collaborator respectively (with people I've never met or talked to trying to approach me via linkedin and other means suggesting new people that get hired at Quby are also getting involved to this day) in order to provide a macabre attempt at a moral lesson (reminiscent of fascist ideology) via the foul methods I've been subjected to.

i4:58pm - As I went outside to get some food a high amplitude noise payload specifically modulated to target my left inner ear and induce a psychotic episode to lead me to hit myself in public or stab myself in the head with a screwdriver forcing me to return home immediately where I assume I'm not even going to be allowed to eat my lunch in peace with sub-human individuals trying to force me to talk to myself at all cost followed by attempting to induce genital self-mutilation like every single day in the past few weeks these individuals associated to Tito Eurico Miranda Fernandes, Luis Nazareth Carvalho Figueira, Pedro Grilo and several other former students from Colégio Militar and the individuals recruited for this purpose.
