00:12pm - Insistence in forcing more genital self-mutilation by focusing a new continuous stream of noxious stimuli on my genitalia immediately after I mutilated myself combined with the unintentional vocal payload I was forced top hear just before it started - "Vaita pr√≥ caralho SOFIA". 

00:23am - Forced to feel an oscillatory noise payload focused on my ears simulating the rhythm of masturbation to force me into a psychotic episode. 

13:03pm - Since the last timed entry I've been forced to hear repeated vocal payloads specifically constructed and delivered to force involuntary tongue movements that might lead to entering a psychotic state and commit tongue self-mutilation. Now I'm being forced to feel a continuous stream of noxious stimuli focused on my genitals combined with induced hyperhidrosis to the point sweat drips from my fingers and I can't type followed by being being forced to feel the oscillatory noise payload at a rhythm simulating masturbation to force me to enter a psychotic state and commit genital self-mutilation again. This has lasted for 5 minutes continuously taking advantage of the fact I have to type each character to deliver more noxious stimuli focused on my genitals combined with oscillatory noise payloads simulating masturbation focused on my ears. 

13:56 pm - Attempting to force myself to commit suicide by sticking a screwdriver in the head forcing me to feel pain and itching (so deep and irritating inside the ear that all cognitive functions are overcome / ignored) as if I were being stabbed in the ear or itching so irritating I can't scratch. This harmful stimulus was accompanied by more harmful genital stimuli and induced hyperhidrosis to force the result of suicide or genital self-mutilation. 

17:43 pm - Since the last complaint, I continue to be forced to feel a quasi-continuous train of vibrotactile sensations focused on my genitals, testicles and perineum resulting from the remote control of mechanoreceptors and nociceptors in my body combined with induced hyperhidrosis in order to create anxiety , instigating feelings of fear and forcing me to stay at home all day like an inmate contemplating suicide and typing with 2 fingers in fear and forcing me to stay at home all day like an inmate contemplating suicide and typing with 2 fingers to torture to which I am subjected while desperately trying to avoid genital self-mutilation. I am forced to live like this by PSP agents, alumni of the military college. 

19:50 pm - New attempt by several military college alumni, psp agents and individuals recruited for the purpose to force my suicide via continuous torture, forcing me to feel vibrotactile sensations focused on my genital area so irritating that I don't have even time to think, This stimulus is focused remotely on my genitals controlling mechanoreceptors and nociceptors remotely to make me feel penetrated like my genitals controlling mechanoreceptors and nociceptors remotely to make me feel penetrated as if I had a vagina. This has been going on all day since I opened my eyes to force genital self-mutilation. Other stimuli were also added throughout the day such as an oscillatory stimulus to simulate the pattern of masturbation focused on my ears and hyperhidrosis induced to the point of barely being able to type this.
